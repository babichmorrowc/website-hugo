<div id="inspiration-for-this-post" class="section level2">
<h2>Inspiration for this post</h2>
<p>When I updated my website to the latest version of Hugo Academic a few months ago, I realized that I could add featured images to all of my blog posts. I was very excited about this, but none of my tinkering with the YAML of the RMarkdown could produce an image. After some digging, however, I was able to find how to format my files properly so the Academic theme worked to create the images.</p>
</div>
<div id="folder-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Folder structure</h2>
<p>Hugo Academic follows a particular folder structure and naming conventions. When I am adding or editing blog posts, for example, I do that within the <code>/content/post</code> folder. Inside that folder, there is a <code>_index.md</code> file with a YAML header, and then an array of posts. You can put the <code>.Rmd</code> or <code>.md</code> files directly inside <code>post</code>, so the file path would look something like <code>/content/post/my_post.Rmd</code>. If you use <code>blogdown</code> to create posts from within RStudio, those posts will be created inside the <code>post</code> folder in that way by default.</p>
<p>In order to set up your post to use a featured image, however, you want the post inside a subsequent folder, like this <code>/content/post/my_post/</code>. Within that folder, call your post <code>index.Rmd</code> (or <code>index.md</code> if it is a Markdown file). Then, you can add the image you want to that same folder and name it <code>featured.png</code> / <code>featured.jpg</code>, etc.</p>
<p>So now you have a set-up like this within <code>/content/post</code>:</p>
<pre><code>├── post
│   ├── my_post
│   │   ├── featured.png
│   │   ├── index.Rmd
│   │   └── index.html
    └── _index.md</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="yaml-header" class="section level2">
<h2>YAML header</h2>
<p>The final step is to modify the YAML header of your post (in <code>index.Rmd</code>) to display the featured image as desired. Add the following to the YAML header:</p>
<pre><code>image:
  placement: 1
  caption: &#39;Your caption here.&#39;
  focal_point: &#39;&#39;
  preview_only: false</code></pre>
<p>In Hugo Academic, the <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1175">placement options</a> are as follows: 1 = Full column width, 2 = Out-set, 3 = Screen-width (with 1 being the default). The focal point options are Smart, Center, TopLeft, Top, TopRight, Left, Right, BottomLeft, Bottom, BottomRight, although I haven’t played with those much.</p>
