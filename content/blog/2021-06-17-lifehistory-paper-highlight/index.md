I wanted to make a quick (and somewhat belated) post announcing that my paper about the life history strategies of tetrapods was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B earlier this year. You can read the paper [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.0200).

As you might be able to tell from the date of the preprint in 2019 compared to the date of publication in 2021, this project has been quite the labor of love (and hate and everything in between). In fact, I started working on this research all the way back in 2017, while I was working in the [Kerkhoff Lab](https://kerkhofflab.org/) at Kenyon College. Throughout 1 more year of college, 2 job positions since, and 3+ manuscript positions, I've had this work in the back of my mind as my baby. Now at long last, my first first-author publication is out in the world! While the process was long and arduous, I'm incredibly proud of how everything turned out. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, just drop me a line -- I would love to hear from you.
