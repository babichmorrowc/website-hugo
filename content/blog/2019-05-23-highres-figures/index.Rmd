## Inspiration for this post

I recently needed to make some figures to present and noticed that the ones I was importing from saved R plots were showing up fuzzy on the presentation. Shortly afterwards, I had interns trying to generate figures with the same aspect ratio from different computers. I did a little digging and found this method for saving figures with specified resolutions and aspect ratios.

## Solution

In order to save your figure with a certain size and resolution, you just need to include your code for plotting between the two lines below:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# To save a .png file:
png("your_image.png", units = "in", width = 5, height = 4, res = 300)
# your plotting code here
dev.off()
```

You can also save .bmp, .jpeg, and .tiff files in the same way with the `bmp`, `jpeg` and `tiff` functions.

## Example

To see this in practice, we can plot some data from the iris dataset the "regular" way:

```{r}
pairs(iris[,1:4], col = iris$Species)
```

Things look pretty nice in the plotting window, but when you save that figure from RStudio, this is the result:

<figure>
  <img class="special-img-class" style="width:80%" src="/img/lowres.png" />
</figure>

To get rid of that graininess, we can instead save the figure in the following way:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
png("highres.png", units = "in", width = 5, height = 4, res = 300)
pairs(iris[,1:4], col = iris$Species)
dev.off()
```

The resulting figure is much clearer and ready to be inserted in presentations or publications!

<figure>
  <img class="special-img-class" style="width:80%" src="/img/highres.png" />
</figure>

You can also change the aspect ratio by modifying the `height` and `width` arguments. You can leave the units in inches or set it to pixels (`"px"`), centimeters (`"cm"`), or millimeters (`"mm"`).
