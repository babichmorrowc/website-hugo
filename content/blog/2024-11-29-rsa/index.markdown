This month, I wrote a blog for the [Compass blog](https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) about regional sensitivity analysis. Regional Sensitivity Analysis is a method for understanding how uncertainty in model input affects uncertainty in output, particularly in settings with continous inputs and discrete outputs. My post can be found here: https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/11/21/student-perspectives-regional-sensitivity-analysis/.
