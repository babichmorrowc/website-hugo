# Biography

I am currently a PhD Student at the University of Bristol in the [Compass program](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/).

From the fall of 2019 to the fall of 2023, I worked as a data scientist at [Spring Health](https://www.springhealth.com/), a start-up delivering precision mental healthcare. I worked to understand the impact of therapy and psychiatry appointments on patients' depression and anxiety, as well as analyzing member behavior as part of the Member Experience team.

Previously, I was a [Helen Fellow](https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/higher-education/helen-fellowship) at the American Museum of Natural History. I worked with Mary Blair in the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation on the open-source species distribution modeling software [Wallace](https://wallaceecomod.github.io/). In addition to working on testing and expanding the Wallace software, I modeled the distributions of three species of three-toed sloths to better understand the biogeography of these species.

During my undergraduate degree at Kenyon College, I worked with Drew Kerkhoff in the [Kenyon Macroecology Laboratory](https://kerkhofflab.org/). As a Kenyon Summer Science Scholar in 2016, I collaborated with researchers at the University of Arizona and Oxford University to develop and test new hypervolume methods for quantifying plant functional diversity and environmental niches. My senior honors thesis used these hypervolume methods to compare dimensionless life history stratgies across tetrapods to examine how these traits have evolved in response to different evolutionary pressures.
