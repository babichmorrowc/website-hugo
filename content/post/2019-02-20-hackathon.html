<p>Last weekend I had the opportunity to participate in my first ever hackathon: the #HackTheSolarSystem hackathon hosted by the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<div id="what-is-a-hackathon-anyways" class="section level2">
<h2>What is a hackathon, anyways?</h2>
<p>This is a question I got asked countless times this last week as I informed my friends and family that I would be at work <strong>all</strong> weekend (yes, including Friday night, yes, including Saturday night, no, I will not be able to socialize at all). And, in fairness, this is a question I wouldn’t have had an answer to prior to this job. A hackathon is an event where participants come together to use technology to address a challenge. Usually, the event takes place over a few days, where hackers form teams and collaborate on their projects, before presenting their solutions.</p>

<h2>The AMMH Hackathon</h2>
<p>For the past five years, the American Museum of Natural History has hosted a hackathon. #HackTheSolarSystem is the first and only hackathon I have participated in thus far, so I can’t compare it to other events, but the museum seeks to put on a slightly different type of event than other hackathons: AMNH wants to give technologists and scientists the opportunity to work together to create solutions to real research problems. For #HackTheSolarSystem, museum scientists from the Department of Earth and Planetary Science put forth a series of challenges they face in their research that they thought could be solved through technology. These challenges ranged from tracking dust particles through aerogel to visualizing the Sun (a full list of challenges is available <a href="https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/wiki/Challenges">here</a>). In addition to the scientific challenges, there were also educational challenges for both high school students and educators.</p>
<p>On Friday night, the museum “stakeholders”, i.e. the scientists posing the challenges, presented their challenges and led participants on tours of various areas of the museum, like the Hall of Meteorites and the Earth and Planetary Sciences department. Then, from Saturday at 2:00 pm to Sunday at 1:00 pm, us hackers stayed at the museum to develop solutions to our chosen challenges. Most hackers worked on teams formed at the event, although some corporate teams came into the hackathon with a team already formed.</p>
