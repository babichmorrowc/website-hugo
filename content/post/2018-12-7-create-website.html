<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I’ve been contemplating the idea of creating a website for sometime, but my initial (mostly half-hearted) attempts ran into some serious technological glitches. I started out trying to create a GitHub site using Jekyll, since I knew I wanted my website to be hosted via GitHub to keep all of my code in the same place. After about an hour of unsuccessful commits that resulted in a lovely white page with my name on it, I scrapped the whole venture until I heard about the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> R package. Since R is my programming language of choice, the idea of being able to write posts in RMarkdown and preview my site from the comfort of RStudio was tremendously appealing. I saw a research site created through Hugo’s Academic theme using <code>blogdown</code> that referenced some helpful tutorials and decided to give the process another shot.</p>

<h2>Hugo + <code>blogdown</code></h2>
<p>After my initial failures with Jekyll, I knew enough about the process (and my own skills) to be wary of the Academic theme’s optimistic tagline “Create a beautifully simple site in under 10 minutes”. So fair warning: getting this site up and semi-running was the work of an afternoon plus. I am not going to provide a full tutorial here, since several excellent ones already exist, but I will give my input on which resources worked for me and where I had difficulties.</p>

<h3>Useful resources</h3>
<p>I started out following <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/">Amber Thomas’s instructions</a> for using <code>blogdown</code>, Hugo, and GitHub pages to create a website. I probably should have taken better note of her initial disclaimer that simpler methods of creating a site exist, but nonetheless I found her instructions useful for wrapping my head around the method behind the whole process. As she explains, GitHub pages and Hugo work in different ways: GitHub pages uses information from the master branch of the repository to build your website, while Hugo builds a website inside the public folder. The solution she presents in her tutorial creates a sub branch within GitHub. She provides some shell scripts written by <a href="https://www.hjdskes.nl">Jente Hidskes</a> that create the sub branch and also update the site. These did not run for me for whatever reason – I believe Hidskes has written an updated tutorial to fix them, however.</p>
<p>While I was reading the comments on Thomas’s tutorials to try to troubleshoot the shell script problems, I found a different <a href="http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/">tutorial by Robert McDonnell</a> that promised a more streamlined approach. McDonnell gets around the GitHub/Hugo conflicts by creating two GitHub repositories, one for the website (for example, my repo is called <a href="https://github.com/babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io">babichmorrowc.github.io</a>) and one for all of the Hugo and <code>blogdown</code> content (mine is called <a href="https://github.com/babichmorrowc/website-hugo">website-hugo</a>).</p>
<p>To link these two repositories, Thomas has users create a <a href="https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/">Git Submodule</a> using the following code:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>git submodule add -b master git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git public</code></pre>
<p>This is where, once again, I ran into difficulties. I kept getting the error:</p>
<pre><code>Cloning into &#39;&lt;filepath&gt;/website-hugo/public&#39;...
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
fatal: clone of &#39;git@github.com:babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git&#39; into submodule path &#39;&lt;filepath&gt;/website-hugo/public&#39; failed
</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, there turned out to be an easy fix for this – the code McDonnell provides uses the SSH URL, which is something I do not have set up. I replaced it with the HTTPS URL (code below), and went on my merry way.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>git submodule add -b master https://github.com/babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git public</code></pre>
