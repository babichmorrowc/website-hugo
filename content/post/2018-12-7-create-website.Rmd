## Getting started

I've been contemplating the idea of creating a website for sometime, but my initial (mostly half-hearted) attempts ran into some serious technological glitches. I started out trying to create a GitHub site using Jekyll, since I knew I wanted my website to be hosted via GitHub to keep all of my code in the same place. After about an hour of unsuccessful commits that resulted in a lovely white page with my name on it, I scrapped the whole venture until I heard about the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package. Since R is my programming language of choice, the idea of being able to write posts in RMarkdown and preview my site from the comfort of RStudio was tremendously appealing. I saw a research site created through Hugo's Academic theme using `blogdown` that referenced some helpful tutorials and decided to give the process another shot.

### Hugo + `blogdown`

After my initial failures with Jekyll, I knew enough about the process (and my own skills) to be wary of the Academic theme's optimistic tagline "Create a beautifully simple site in under 10 minutes". So fair warning: getting this site up and semi-running was the work of an afternoon plus. I am not going to provide a full tutorial here, since several excellent ones already exist, but I will give my input on which resources worked for me and where I had difficulties.

## Useful resources

I started out following [Amber Thomas's instructions](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/) for using `blogdown`, Hugo, and GitHub pages to create a website. I probably should have taken better note of her initial disclaimer that simpler methods of creating a site exist, but nonetheless I found her instructions useful for wrapping my head around the method behind the whole process. As she explains, GitHub pages and Hugo work in different ways: GitHub pages uses information from the master branch of the repository to build your website, while Hugo builds a website inside the public folder. The solution she presents in her tutorial creates a sub branch within GitHub. She provides some shell scripts written by [Jente Hidskes](https://www.hjdskes.nl) that create the sub branch and also update the site. These did not run for me for whatever reason -- I believe Hidskes has written an updated tutorial to fix them, however.

While I was reading the comments on Thomas's tutorials to try to troubleshoot the shell script problems, I found a different [tutorial by Robert McDonnell](http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/) that promised a more streamlined approach. McDonnell gets around the GitHub/Hugo conflicts by creating two GitHub repositories, one for the website (for example, my repo is called [babichmorrowc.github.io](https://github.com/babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io)) and one for all of the Hugo and `blogdown` content (mine is called [website-hugo](https://github.com/babichmorrowc/website-hugo)).

To link these two repositories, Thomas has users create a [Git Submodule](https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) using the following code:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git submodule add -b master git@github.com:<username>/<username>.github.io.git public
```

This is where, once again, I ran into difficulties. I kept getting the error:

```
Cloning into '<filepath>/website-hugo/public'...
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
fatal: clone of 'git@github.com:babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git' into submodule path '<filepath>/website-hugo/public' failed

```

Fortunately, there turned out to be an easy fix for this -- the code McDonnell provides uses the SSH URL, which is something I do not have set up. I replaced it with the HTTPS URL (code below), and went on my merry way.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git public
```

## Pushing to GitHub

From that point forward, I had a functioning site that I could preview in RStudio using the `serve_site()` function. Using the following Git commands, I could push those changes and get that same site up and running online:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# From the folder for the repo website-hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "new commit!"
git push origin master

cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "new commit part 2"
git push
```


## Editing my site

I'm still learning my way around the format of the Hugo site, but by some trial and error I've started the process of customizing the site. I am using the [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) theme. So far I've managed to update my bio, add a publication, and take a stab at creating projects. As I get more familiarity with the format, I will try for a more comprehensive blog post explaining how to add your own content.
