<p>Earlier this month I participated in the American Museum of Natural History’s annual hackathon (see my last <a href="https://babichmorrowc.github.io/post/2019-02-14-hackathon/">post</a> for details about the event overall). During the hackathon, I worked with Katy Abbott, another Helen Fellow at the museum with me, to use a machine learning algorithm called DBSCAN to tackle our challenge.</p>

<h2>Challenge accepted</h2>
<p>Our team, consisting of Peter Kang, Jackson Lee, Jeremy Neiman, John Underwood, Katy Abbott, Meret Götschel, and myself, chose to work on the <a href="https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/wiki/Meteorite-Mineral-Mapping">Meteorite Mineral Mapping challenge</a>. For this challenge, our museum stakeholders, Marina Gemma and Sam Alpert, wanted a way to identify the mineral composition of meteorites.</p>

<h2>Pixels to percents</h2>
<p>The scientists scan meteorites with an electron microprobe, a device that provides the intensity of x-rays emitted from certain elements. The electron microprobe results in images with grayscale intensities corresponding to these x-ray intensities on a pixel-by-pixel basis.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
Images of a meteorite produced by the electron microprobe showing pixel intensities for each of 10 elements - brighter grayscale values indicate greater amounts of that element in a pixel.

</figure>
<p>Our first step was to convert these pixel intensities to the percent weight of each element in the mineral at that pixel. To do that, we referred to a set of standard images taken of minerals with a known proportion of each element. For example, the image below shows the pixel intensities of iron in 8 minerals: you can see that the pixels are brightest in Fe, or pure iron, and lower in iron oxide (<span class="math inline">\(\text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4\)</span>) and troilite, or iron sulfide (FeS).</p>

<p>We can relate the intensity of the iron pixels in the Fe mineral, for example, to the percent weight in that mineral (100%, since iron is the only element in Fe). There is a linear relationship between pixel intensity and percent weight, so we used linear regression to find the slope of this relationship.</p>
