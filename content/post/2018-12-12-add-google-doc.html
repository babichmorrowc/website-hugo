<p>Given that the Academic website theme comes with a place to upload talks, I thought I might as well upload the slides for my Senior Honors presentation. Unfortunately, this was a slightly more difficult task than I anticipated. The default format for slides in Hugo appears to be Markdown slides, which is fine, except when your talk was made in Google Slides.</p>
<div id="google-slides-to-markdown" class="section level2">
<h2>Google Slides to Markdown?</h2>
<p>My first thought was that there must be some tool to convert a Google slides talk into a Markdown document. For whatever reason, there are several tools (like <a href="https://github.com/gsuitedevs/md2googleslides">this GitHub repo</a>) to go the other direction, from Markdown to Google slides. I found a GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md"><code>gdocs2md</code></a> that claimed to go in the other direction, but the script provided doesn’t currently run (if anyone is a whiz at Google Apps and wants to take a stab at fixing up this code, it would be a great tool!). There is a Google Drive add-on called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gd2md-html/igffnbdfnodiaphfmfaiiaegmoljbghf">GD2md-html</a> that converts Google Docs to Markdown or HTML, which should be useful for the future, but it doesn’t help with Google Slides.</p>

<h2>Embedding Google Slides in Hugo</h2>
<p>Having abandoned the idea of just converting my current slides into Markdown and going on my merry way, I started looking for a way to embed the Google Slides themselves into my website.</p>
<div id="hugo-shortcodes" class="section level3">
<h3>Hugo shortcodes</h3>
<p>Hugo has certain snippets called <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a> that are designed to address the problem of having to add raw HTML into Markdown. These shortcodes help render a content file according to a template created by Hugo. For example, the shortcode <code>figure</code> adds HTML functionality to the Markdown image syntax. There are shortcodes for Instagram (<code>instagram</code>), Vimeo (<code>vimeo</code>) and Twitter (<code>tweet</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-gdocs-shortcode" class="section level3">
<h3>The <code>gdocs</code> shortcode</h3>
<p>One of these shortcodes, <code>gdocs</code>, allows you to embed all Google doc types (Slides, Docs, Sheets, etc.) into your website. The HTML code for the shortcode can be found in the <code>hugo-academic</code> GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/gdocs.html" class="uri">https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/gdocs.html</a>.</p>
<p>I tried inserting the following into the <code>index.md</code> file for my talk below the line with three <code>+</code> signs:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>{{&lt; gdocs &quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSj-oftLksGEKTkzCoBSIpzooO61ZMGAUzoGBv7u20OzMQK8ctX3gCpWTMm4UowrrWumFrdQsY0Cd/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=5000&quot; &gt;}}</code></pre>
<p>I got the URL by going to my Google Slides, and clicking File &gt; Publish to the web. I selected Embed and copied the link following <code>src=</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this didn’t result in anything showing up on my page besides a large blank space where I assume Hugo was trying to put my presentation. I tried some variations on the above code, including adding <code>src=</code> before the URL (no change), and moving the entire code snippet above the <code>+++</code> line in <code>index.md</code> (results in the error ” unmarshal failed: Near line 65 (last key parsed ‘image’): bare keys cannot contain ‘{’ “).</p>
</div>
<div id="html-code" class="section level3">
<h3>HTML code</h3>
<p>At this point, I was feeling pretty discouraged, when I happened upon a <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/shortcode-for-google-slide-presentation-embed/3464">Hugo forum post</a> with the HTML code someone used to embed a Google Slides presentation. I have hardly any familiarity with HTML, but clearly shortcodes and I weren’t getting along very well, so I decided to give it a shot. I copied and pasted the code from the forum, replacing the URL following <code>src=</code> with my link from above, and voila! My slides appeared on the post.</p>
<p>Here is the code for reference:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSj-oftLksGEKTkzCoBSIpzooO61ZMGAUzoGBv7u20OzMQK8ctX3gCpWTMm4UowrrWumFrdQsY0Cd/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=5000&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="moral-of-the-story" class="section level2">
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>It seems like shortcodes can be a really valuable feature of Hugo, especially should I ever need to include a video of some kind (or if I actually start using Twitter again <em>and</em> tweet something worth sharing, two improbable events). In the case of Google Docs/Sheets/etc., however, just using the HTML code snippet seems like the easiest option (and is a good motivation to learn HTML at a later date).</p>
