Should you have ever wanted a crash course in decision-making from someone notoriously indecisive, now is your chance. Bayesian Decision Analysis (BDA) is a powerful framework for making decisions under a state of uncertainity. In this lightning talk, we will explore how we can apply this tool to navigate our uncertain world while keeping that pesky indecision at bay.
