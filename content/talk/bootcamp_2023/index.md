In the Bootcamp unit of Compass, we were tasked with learning independently about a mathematical topic relevant to our thesis and presenting at the end of the term. In this talk, I provide an overview of the St. Petersburg Paradox and present utility functions as a way to address the paradox. The talk provides a proof of the Von-Neumann Morgenstern Utility Theorem.
